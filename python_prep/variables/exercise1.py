# Classify the following potential non-constant variable names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.
# 
# index - idiomatic
# CatName - non-idiomatic because it uses CamelCase rather than snake_case
# lazy_dog - idiomatic
# quick_Fox - non-idiomatic because it uses a capital F
# 1stCharacter - illegal - can't start a variable name with a number
# operand2 - idiomatic
# BIG_NUMBER - non-idiomatic - this is the version for constants not non-constants, but Python won't stop you
# Ï€ - non-idiomatic
