# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at
# least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# Lists are mutable, tuples are not.
# Copying the solution, but list literals use brackets [] and tuple literals
# use ()

# Both Lists and tuples are heterogeneous, so they can contain a variety
# of object types inside them.
# Both are also iterable sequences where oder matter, and you can index into them.
