# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:

# foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?

# Yes, it will result in an IndexError because you're trying to access and index that doesn't exist.
