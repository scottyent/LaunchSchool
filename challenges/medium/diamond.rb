# All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
# The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
# The diamond is vertically symmetric.
# The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
# The letters form a diamond shape.
# The top half has the letters in ascending order.
# The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
