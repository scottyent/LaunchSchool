# Create a clock that is independent of date.

# You should be able to add minutes to and subtract minutes from the time
# represented by a given Clock object. Note that you should not mutate
# Clock objects when adding and subtracting minutes -- create a new Clock object.

# Two clock objects that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

# You may not use any built-in date or time functionality; just use arithmetic
# operations.
