The Greek mathematician Nicomachus devised a classification scheme for natural
numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories
of abundant, perfect, or deficient based on a comparison between the number and
the sum of its positive divisors (the numbers that can be evenly divided into
  the target number with no remainder, excluding the number itself).
  For instance, the positive divisors of 15 are 1, 3, and 5. This sum is known
  as the Aliquot sum.

Perfect numbers have an Aliquot sum that is equal to the original number.
Abundant numbers have an Aliquot sum that is greater than the original number.
Deficient numbers have an Aliquot sum that is less than the original number.

Write a program that can tell whether a number is perfect, abundant,
or deficient.
