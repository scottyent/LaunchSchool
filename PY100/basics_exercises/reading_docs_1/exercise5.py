# Locate the documentation for the list built-in object in Python Documentation.
# How can we access the second element ('and') in the list ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?

# Referencing the common sequence operations
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-common

# We would be able to index into the list by using list[1] notation since index
# starts at 0 for the first element.

# I gave the example just calling it list, but it would need to be stored into
# a variable and then written like that (dinner[1] is the example they gave)
# or you can also index directly from the list itself: ['fish', 'and', 'chips'][1]
