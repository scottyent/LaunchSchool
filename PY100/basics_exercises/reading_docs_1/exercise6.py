# Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods that allow for common
# list manipulations. One such operation is determining the index of an item
# in the list.

# Given a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "peach", "watermelon"]

# How would you determine the index of the fruit "cherry" in this list?

print(fruits.index('cherry'))
