# Using the Python documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a
# way that makes them easier to read.

# You can use underscores to separate, e.g. 1_000_000 for one million

# Further exploration: You could write the numbers that way, there's nothing
# preventing you from doing it, but it depends on the convention in your
# country whether that is the most readable version of the number.
