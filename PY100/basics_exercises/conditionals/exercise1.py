# Without looking at your notes or the official documentation, try to recall
# all values that count as falsy in Python.

# None is falsey
# False is falsey

# That's it?

# oh wow, there are a lot more:

# 0, 0.0, 0j, and other numeric zero-values
# '' (an empty string)
# [] (an empty list)
# {} (an empty dictionary)
# () (an empty tuple)
# set() (an empty set)
# range(0) (an empty range)

# So it seems empty evaluates to false (empty sequences and consequences)
