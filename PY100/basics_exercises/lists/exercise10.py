# We generated parts of a passcode and now want to combine them into a string.
# Write some code that creates and prints a string that contains each portion
# of the passcode separated by hyphens (-).

passcode = ['11', 'jZ5', 'hQ3f*', '8!7g3', 'p3Fs']

print('-'.join(passcode))
# Expected output: 11-jZ5-hQ3f*-8!7g3-p3Fs
