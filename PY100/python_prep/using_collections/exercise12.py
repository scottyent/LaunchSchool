# Write some code that determines and prints whether the number 3 appears
# inside each of these lists:

numbers1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
numbers2 = []
numbers3 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
numbers4 = ['1', '3', '5']
numbers5 = ['1', 3.0, '5']

print(3 in numbers1)
print(3 in numbers2)
print(3 in numbers3)
print(3 in numbers4)
print(3 in numbers5)
