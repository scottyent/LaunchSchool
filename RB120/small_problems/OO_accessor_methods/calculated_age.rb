# Using the following code, multiply @age by 2 upon assignment, then
# multiply @age by 2 again when @age is returned by the getter method.

# class Person
#   def age=(age)
#     @age = age * 2
#   end

#   def age
#     @age * 2
#   end
# end

# Another way to do it:
class Person
  def age=(age)
    @age = double(age)
  end

  def age
    double(@age)
  end

  private

  def double(num)
    num * 2
  end
end


person1 = Person.new
person1.age = 20
puts person1.age
