# The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment
# for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to
# prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even if
# the vehicle is out of fuel.

# Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles
# is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range
# method will return an additional 10km.
